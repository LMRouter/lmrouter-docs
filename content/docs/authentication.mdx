LMRouter supports two types of authentication:

* API Key Authentication
* Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

## API Key Authentication

You can create an API key in your [dashboard](https://lmrouter.com/dashboard/api-keys). To use the API key, you can supply it as the `Authorization` header in your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer <LMROUTER_API_KEY>
```

or as the `X-API-Key` header:

```
X-API-Key: <LMROUTER_API_KEY>
```

OpenAI-compatible clients will supply the API key in the `Authorization` header by default, and Anthropic-compatible clients will supply the API key in the `X-API-Key` header by default.

## BYOK Authentication

If you want to use your own API key for a third-party provider, you can do so by supplying the API key as the `Authorization` header in your requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer BYOK:<THIRD_PARTY_API_KEY>
```

or as the `X-API-Key` header:

```
X-API-Key: BYOK:<THIRD_PARTY_API_KEY>
```

If you are using your own API key, you can use a custom model supplied by the third-party provider in your requests, even if the model is not supported by LMRouter. Just pass `<PROVIDER_NAME>:<MODEL_NAME>` as the model name in your requests.

**We do not charge you for using your own API key.**
