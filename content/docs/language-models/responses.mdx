description: Generate responses with LMRouter
---

The responses endpoint provided by LMRouter is compatible with the OpenAI responses endpoint. It is available at

```
https://api.lmrouter.com/openai/v1/responses
```

Please refer to the [OpenAI responses endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses/create) for more information on how to use the responses endpoint.

## Conversation State

Even if the provider doesn't support Responses API, you are able to use the LMRouter Responses API to maintain [conversation state](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/conversation-state#passing-context-from-the-previous-response). You can pass the previous response ID as the `previous_response_id` parameter in the request. LMRouter will be able to retrieve the previous response and use it to generate the next response.
