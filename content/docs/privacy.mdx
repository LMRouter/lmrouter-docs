This Privacy Policy explains how LMRouter Contributors ("we," "us," or "our") collect, use, and share information about you when you use our Service.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information to provide and improve our Service.

* **Information You Provide:**
    * **Account Information:** When you register, we collect your name, email address, and a hashed version of your password. If you sign up using a social provider (e.g., Google), we may receive your name, email, and profile picture.
    * **API Keys:** When you generate an API key, we store a secure hash of the key and its prefix for identification and verification.
* **Information We Collect Automatically:**
    * **Usage Data:** We log information about your API requests to facilitate billing and monitoring. This includes the models used, timestamps, status codes, IP address, and usage metrics (e.g., token counts).
    * **Session Data:** We collect standard log information, including your IP address and user agent, when you interact with our website and dashboard for security and analytics.
* **Information We Process on Your Behalf:**
    * **API Content:** We process the Content (prompts, images, audio, etc.) you send through our API. This data is passed directly to the third-party AI Provider you select. We act as a transient pass-through for this data.
    * **Conversation History:** For features that require context (like the OpenAI-compatible Responses API), we may temporarily cache conversation history. This data is stored only for the duration necessary to provide the feature and is not used for any other purpose.

## 3. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal information. We may share it with the following parties for specific purposes:

* **Third-Party AI Providers:** Your API requests and Content are sent to the Provider you choose to fulfill your request. Their use of your data is governed by their respective privacy policies.
* **Service Providers:** We use third-party vendors for payment processing (Stripe), email delivery (Resend), and hosting/database infrastructure (e.g., Cloudflare, Neon). These vendors only have access to the information necessary to perform their functions.
* **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process.

## 4. Data Security and Retention

* **Security:** We implement security measures to protect your information. We hash sensitive data like passwords and API keys and use secure protocols (HTTPS) for data transmission.
* **Retention:**
    * **API Content:** Content sent through our API is processed transiently and is **not stored long-term** on our servers, except for temporary caching required by specific features as described above.
    * **Account & Usage Data:** We retain your account information and API usage logs as long as your account is active and for a reasonable period afterward for billing, auditing, and legal purposes.

You have rights over your personal data. Through your dashboard, you can:

* Access and update your account information.
* Create, manage, and delete your API keys.
* Delete your account.

If you delete your account, we will remove your personal information, though we may retain some usage data in an anonymized form and data required for legal or financial compliance.
