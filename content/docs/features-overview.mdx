LMRouter provides a single, unified API for all your AI needs. Specifically, it provides an API endpoint that is compatible with both OpenAI and Anthropic clients. This means that you can use LMRouter with any OpenAI or Anthropic compatible client, or drop-in replace your OpenAI endpoint with the LMRouter endpoint, and use the LMRouter API key.

The OpenAI-compatible endpoint is available at

The Anthropic-compatible endpoint is available at
