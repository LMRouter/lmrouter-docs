description: Pricing for LMRouter
---

Pricing on LMRouter is transparent and simple. You pay for the number of tokens (or other units of measure) you use. Pricing for each model is listed on the individual model pages. We do not mark up the price of the models you use.

If you are using your own API key for a third-party provider, you do not pay for the number of tokens you use. You are solely responsible for all costs incurred on that Provider's platform.

There is a small service fee incurred when you top up your credit balance. The fee is 3.9% + $0.30 per transaction.

We reserve the right to expire unused credits after one (1) year from the date of purchase. Credits that remain unused for one year or longer may be removed from your account without prior notice.
