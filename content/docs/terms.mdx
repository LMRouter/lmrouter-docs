Welcome to LMRouter! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the LMRouter website, APIs, and services (collectively, the "Service"), provided by the LMRouter Contributors ("we," "us," or "our").

By creating an account or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

## 1. Description of Service

LMRouter is an all-in-one API router that provides a single, unified interface for developers to connect to various third-party AI model providers ("Providers"). The Service allows you to send requests and receive responses from these Providers using a single API key and a consistent API structure.

The underlying software for LMRouter is open-source and available under the MIT License. These Terms apply specifically to the use of our hosted Service available at `lmrouter.com` and its associated API endpoints.

## 2. User Accounts

* **Registration:** You must create an account to use most features of the Service. You agree to provide accurate, complete, and current information during registration.
* **Security:** You are responsible for safeguarding your account password and all API keys associated with your account. You agree not to disclose your password or API keys to any third party. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.

## 3. Use of the Service

* **Acceptable Use:** You agree not to use the Service for any purpose that is illegal, harmful, or otherwise objectionable. This includes, but is not limited to:

    * Infringing on the intellectual property rights of others.
    * Transmitting any data that is unlawful, abusive, harassing, or defamatory.
    * Attempting to disrupt or compromise the integrity or security of the Service.
* **Your Content:** You retain all rights to the prompts, files, and other data you send through the Service ("Content"). You grant us a limited license to process, store, and transmit your Content solely for the purpose of providing and operating the Service. We are a conduit for your data, and we do not claim any ownership over it.
* **Third-Party Providers:** The Service routes your requests to third-party AI Providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).

* **Refunds:** All purchases are final and non-refundable.
* **Credit Expiration:** We reserve the right to expire unused credits after one (1) year from the date of purchase. Credits that remain unused for one year or longer may be removed from your account without prior notice.
* **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) Mode:** If you use the Service in "BYOK" mode, you provide your own API key for a third-party Provider. You are solely responsible for all costs incurred on that Provider's platform.
